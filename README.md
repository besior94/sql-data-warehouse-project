**Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)**

**Objective**

Design and implement a modern data warehouse in SQL Server to consolidate sales data from multiple sources, supporting analytical reporting and data-driven decision-making.

**Specifications**

- **Data Sources:** Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM), each provided as CSV files.

- **Data Quality:** Perform data cleansing and resolve quality issues before loading the data into the warehouse.

- **Integration**: Merge both datasets into a single, user-friendly data model optimized for analytical queries.
